# The afs.shape above has told me I am dealing with a datset that has 171 columns and 60,000 rows. I will now use the afs.describe(include=object) function to provide me with some basic statistics on the data. This is useful for the following reasons:
# 
# -Count shows me that
# -Unique showes me that
# -Top shows me that
# -Freq shows me that

# Now I begin to view the data. data.head(10) gives me the first 10 rows of the data.
# 
# This allows me to get an understanding of what I am actually dealing with. It is a good way

# As the 'neg' column is not applicable to this project, I will remove them from the data set before I explore any further. "The datasetâ€™s  positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system.
# The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS." This data is unrelated and therefore not useful for my project. Firstly, I will change the data

# I need to get rid of the n/a in the ab_00 column. Below I will experiment with different strategies to do this. Forst, I will explore the classification and regression of the dataset. For this project, I will use multiclass classification.
