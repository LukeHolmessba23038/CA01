You have been retained by a haulage company to analyse a dataset based on data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. You have been retained by a haulage company to analyse a dataset based on data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The dataset’s  positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system.

The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists  of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. This analysis will help determine the investment strategy for the company in the upcoming year.

All data wrangling, analysis, and visualizations must generated using python.

The companies CTO also requires you to rationalize all the decisions that you have made in your report.

Minimum Requirements 

You are required to use the dataset contained within the file “aps_failure_set.csv”, conduct the following analysis and report on your findings:

Characterization of the data set: size; number of attributes; has/does not have missing values, number of observations etc.

Application of Data preparation/evaluation methods (Cleaning, renaming, etc) and EDA visualizations (plural), including a clear and concise explanation of your rationale for what you are doing with the data and why you are doing it.
Use PCA to establish the minimum number of features needed for retaining 99.5% variance in the data and then implement PCA to dimensionally reduce the data to the number of features that you have discovered. Include a clear and concise explanation of your rationale for what you are doing with the data and why you are doing it.
Explain in your own words what the “Curse of Dimensionality ” is and how it may affect your analysis going forward.
Conclusions, Findings of data set and references (HARVARD style).
Note that all written work MUST be completed in Jupyter Notebook Markdown (please review “Jupyter Notebook Tutorial” Notes in Moodle if you are unsure of this).

All Code must be included in code blocks (As normal). No other upload will be accepted.

All written work MUST be detailed in your Jupyter Markdown (NOT in code comments).
